	  <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of <br>
	  the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time,<br>
	  and modern C now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to <br>
	  facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, <br>
	  and many vendors provide C compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, and IBM,<br>
	  so it is available on many platforms.  </P>
